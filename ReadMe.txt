There are 3 ways to run this project

1st) 
->  Go to infoSense folder import both collections (infoSense.accounts , infoSense.products) , my database name is "infoSense" in which 	two collections are there -> accounts and products

-> after importing successfully & extracting all the files just Go to the index.js file (cd MERN in cmd)
   C:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\MERN>   thats how the path is in my pc , respectively in yours . you just have to open the project path in the 	cmd (cd Desktop ,then cd MERN) as my project is in desktop -> MERN (folder) . so just according to you open by using "cd MERN"

-> then use command node index.js or nodemon index.js (if nodemon is installed in your pc)

-> then go to the respective port you will get the project

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2nd)
-> i have one seed file ( productseed.js ) in the data folder , first run this file by " node productseed.js" and for running this you have 	to be in the data folder ( cd data)  " C:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\MERN\data> node productseed.js "
-> then come to the MERN by (cd..) and run nodemon index.js
-> respected port will shows the project
